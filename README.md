Ethereum Track: <Earngit>

# Earngit-matic-Hackbout 
      A decentralized open-source platform  where developers can share their projects and earn incentives too
It uses Ethereum for decentralization and is written in solidity.
It connects to the blockchain using Metamask. 
We provide options for the developers to upload their projects,edit other projects, and like other developers.
We have tokens that allow us to keep track and reward people for contributing to our system , and as the value of the platform grows, the people who built it get to share in its success.
The tokenized system would let every user become a stakeholder in the network
Earn an additional stream of revenue through the unique reward mechanism which is driven by the community by different means
    > sponsorship by the users who wish to encourage the project developers
    > Depending on the upvotes the developer gets for his project they gets incentives accordingly.
    > For editing an already existing project Each editor will put their token into play for each edit.
      If their contribution is accepted, the user gets back the token, which will have obtained value in proportion to the content added
      If the edit is not accepted, the user does not get their token back
 The data is stored in moibit,which is a decentralized secure storage network.
